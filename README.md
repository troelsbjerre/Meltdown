# Meltdown
Ever felt like Nuclear energy was too easy? Now you can have your power production disappear in a mushroom cloud! If a reactor reaches 1000 degrees, it will start to take damage. Without intervention, it will be destroyed in 60 seconds. If a hot reactor (>900 degrees) is removed or destroyed, it will cause a nuclear explosion and release massive amounts of pollution, i.e., you need to cool a reactor down before messing with it. IF YOU PICK UP A REACTOR GOING CRITICAL, IT WILL BLOW UP IN YOUR HANDS!
